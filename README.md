### The NFT Generator

The NFT Generator is able to:

=> Generate a whole NFT collection by creating NFT art by compiling different layers together and turning them into NFT's.
=> All NFT art created by the NFT generated is stored on a so-called IPFS which stands for InterPlanetary File System.
=> NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token and the NFT art is turned into tokens under the ERC721 standard of a smart contract.

MVP-version
👉 In this case, the layers are defined by certain items that have been added to the app.
👉 There are three layers: a background, a bonsai picture and a logo of w3blab Amsterdam.
👉 Once you fill in the amount of NFT's you would like to have generated as input, the NFT art will first be generated.
👉 Then a question comes up, whether you want this collection to be mintable, which means:
➡️ A smart contracyt will be made for this collection
➡️ Accompanying NFT's of which the NFT art was generated before, will be turned into real NFT's.
➡️ First they will be added to the IPFS system, so that the art is at least stored somewhere
➡️ Second, alle of these NFT's will be stored as a collection under a smart contract and that makes them mintable.
➡️ A collection being made mintable means:

- Anybody is able to own this digital asset on the Test network of Polygon
- Anybody is also therefore able to sell this digital assets via the Test network of Polygon

## My process

Steps I've taken to build this NFT Generator:

Test Test git

### Built with

- NextJS
- TailwindCss
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- API route in NextJS app

### Run the App

By using the command `npm run dev`

### Continued development

For future release or next stage, I'd suggest to:
